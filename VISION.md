What It Does
============

The file formats, the interfaces, the tools, and the assistants come together to form a life-centric project management system that allows you to define your life in a way to that makes sense to humans.

There are too many catch all notebook, todo, and journaling projects out there, and they all have something in common: they are very restrictive and get in the way more than they help. We have very limited and poor choices of software when trying to solve the problem of organizing the business of living:

    1. You can live your life in a notekeeper, like Evernote, but with no actual structure to help you organize your life or logic to help you put the elements into use, this usually ends up with an inconsistent and 'dumb' system with all kinds of dusty corners of forgotten notes that were never followed up on.

    2. You can live your life in a todo, like Astrid, and for simple tasks and projects with reminders that notify you when things are overdue, this can really help you get things done, but the limitations are quickly reached, and you are forced to throw notes here and there or try to remember other things that just don't relate. While we are defined by what we do, there is so much more to the equation in defining how and why we do it.

The Structure
=============

Every life needs to be built on a great foundation, so we took great care in laying out the blocks common in every life.

Actions
-------

Actions are at the heart of life and it's no different here. Write definitions and conditional logic in easy to undertand human language that assistants can use to determine when you should do what, when, where, and how long. Instead of forcing you to think like a machine, we're forcing our machines to think like you!

Assistants
----------

Assistants are the workhorses of automation. They process, monitor, notify or report your data to help you get the most out of your life. They might even give you words of wisdom or motivation! Get to know all the assistants and hire the ones that suit you best! Don't worry, they don't charge an arm and a leg, they work for bits!

Decisions
---------

Life is full of them. This is where you can gather all your research in deciding whether you should switch careers, where you should get your education, and if it's really worth paying all that money for a babysitter instead of being a stay-at-home mom. When you've decided what to do, our tools make it simple to convert a decision into a plan or an action.

Frames
------

If Actions are the heart of life, then frames are the body. Frames are ideas that we try to keep in our minds throughout the day to help us achieve our best.

Ideas
-----

Ideas are temporary placeholders for plans and actions. Put them here and our assistants can remind you of ideas you had so you can turn it into a plan or an action. 

Logs
----

History teaches us a lot about ourselves. Our tools will log the progress of your life so you can celebrate your successes and learn from your mistakes.

Plans
-----

Most everything you want to do in life needs a plan. Whether it's a simple reading list or a multi-tiered gantt-worthy project, we let you define it as plainly or extravagantly as you need to, and it's always accessible in a human readable format.

Reference
---------

Sometimes you have things you wanna remember for your life that just don't seem to fit, or perhaps it just makes more sense for it to be referenced by multiple actions, ideas, or logs. Maybe it's a list of your influential music in your life or a list of who to turn to when you need advice. This is just the place to store it. As well as storing any kind of file to open in an external program, we also support HTML and RestructuredText to nicely display it for you directly in the software. Either format supports HoomanLogic special tags that can do all sorts of neat things!

Systems
-------

The Alpha and Omega of Life lies in the systems we adopt, whether consciously or unconsciouly, and the quality of those systems have the greatest affect on the quality of our lives and the accuracy we have in getting what we want out of it. Here we allow you to define complex levels of logic in a human readable text that define the actions and plans with a complete logical structure of when, if, and what to do. Not getting the desired results? You better check your systems!

Syntax & Document Symbols
=========================

List item symbols
-----------------

- signifies a standard item to be completed in a plan
^ signifies a queue item, the top of the list is the next one in the queue. Completed items are moved to the bottom, marked 'x'
o signifies an option. Selecting any of the options will satisfy the plan's target.
